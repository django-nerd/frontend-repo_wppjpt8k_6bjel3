          I craft edits that feel like breathing styles in motion — sharp cuts, explosive hits, and clean storytelling. Tools of choice: Premiere Pro, After Effects, DaVinci Resolve. If you want a hype AMV, a cinematic trailer, or edits for your brand or stream, I bring anime energy with professional polish.
